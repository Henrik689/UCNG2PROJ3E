\subsection{H-Bridge} \fixme{jeg retter igennem når jeg er kommet hjem. Henrik.}

\subsubsection{Equipment}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[•]Elcanic Power Supply
	\item[•]Fluke 45 Multimeter
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Setup}
Power to the H-bridge is supplied by the power supply. Current and voltage will be measured by the multimeter.
All of the MOSFET's were removed before doing the test. It was done to avoid powering the engines.


\subsubsection{Results}
There was a suspicion concerning the H-bridge, it had been measured that there was an error or a damaged component. The affected suspected part was the H-bridge for the left motor.\\

All of the transistors were tested on the part of the H-bridge in question.
Since there was a 0 in value on the base, it is suspected that a resistor which sat on the board just before the transistor. This and the other resistor values were measured and found to be identical, based on the measures it could be concluded that it was most likely a failed transistor.\\

It was concluded that the damaged transistor was the: Q14 \cite{Q14}  
\fixme{link til schematics}.\\

The results were as following:\

Normal NPN transistors: base 0.854V, collector 0.073V\

Faulty NPN transistor. base 0V, collector 0V.\\
