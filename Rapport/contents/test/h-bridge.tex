\subsection{H-Bridge}
The purpose of this test is to verify that the two h-bridges functions as intended.

\subsubsection{Equipment}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[•]Elcanic Power Supply
	\item[•]Fluke 45 Multimeter
	\item[•]ChipKit Uno32 Microcontroller
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Setup}
The h-bridge i controlled with the Uno32 through the logic circuit programmed into the CPLD. The Current draw and voltage of the entire system is measured with two Fluke 45 multimeters. Input power is supplied by the Elcanic power supply.\\
The Uno32 is programmed to test the h-bridge in the following four configurations:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[•]Coast
	\item[•]Power from top left to bottom right
	\item[•]Power from top right to bottom left
	\item[•]Break
\end{enumerate}

\caption{Results from first test of h-bridge}
\label{firsthbridgetest}
\end{table}
There was a suspicion concerning the H-bridge, it had been measured that there was an error or a damaged component. The affected suspected part was the H-bridge for the left motor.\\

All of the transistors were tested on the part of the H-bridge in question.
Since there was a 0 in value on the base, it is suspected that a resistor which sat on the board just before the transistor. This and the other resistor values were measured and found to be identical, based on the measures it could be concluded that it was most likely a failed transistor.\\

It was concluded that the damaged transistor was the: Q14 \cite{Q14}  
\fixme{link til schematics}.\\

The results were as following:\

Normal NPN transistors: base 0.854V, collector 0.073V\

Faulty NPN transistor. base 0V, collector 0V.\\
