\subsection{Ultrasound HC-SR04}
The purpose of this test is to measure is the HRC-S04 Ultrasonic distance sensor is reliable at reading the distance to an object.

\subsubsection{Equipment}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[•]Agilent MSO-X 3024A Oscilloscope 
    \item[•]Arduino UNO Microcontroller  
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Setup}
A small program for the Arduino has been written which allows the MCU to trigger the sensor and waits a pre-specified amount of time before triggering again, to allow for the return of the ultrasound wave. 

\subsubsection{Results}
In order to to validate to the results we can calculate the actual measured length using the speed of sound, which is $ 340.29 \frac{M}{s} $ or $2.9\frac{\mu s}{mm}$. To calculate the distance we can use: $(\frac{time}{speed of sound})/2$ \cite{SOF}

The results show that when measuring objects closer that one meter the sensor is accurate within spec of $\pm 1cm$
