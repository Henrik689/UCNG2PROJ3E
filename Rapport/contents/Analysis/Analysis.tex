In this section the problems found when trying to get the robot function, will be listed and analysed

\section{Problem statement}

The problem presented to the group is how to make a robot move from point A to point B, with the help of different sensors, including ultrasound and infrared, and to make use of autonomous algorithms to avoid obstacles. \\

Problem statement:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[•]Bot should be able to move from A to B
\item[•]Should be able to stop at a predetermined point
\item[•]Manoeuvre around obstacles
\end{enumerate}

\section{Problem analysis}
\subsection{Mobility from A to B}
The robot receives a coordinate to reach, and will use its own starting point to determine a direction to drive towards the given coordinate. The robot will need a way to control its movement and direct current to function optimal.\\
The robot needs a way to effectively regulate speed and also steer itself autonomously. To dictate how quickly the robot moves, the robot will need some system that allows it to move around on a flat surface, the robot needs to be able to move around from point A to point B.
.\

\subsection{Predetermined end point}
After starting, the robot needs to know when to stop. The pre-determined end-point consists of a series of circles which the robot needs to detect. 

\subsection{Obstacles avoidance}
As part of its functionality, the robot needs to be able to see objects that are in front of it and avoid them.
