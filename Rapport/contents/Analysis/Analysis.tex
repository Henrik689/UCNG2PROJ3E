\section{Problem statement}

The problem presented to the group is how to make a robot move from point A to point B, with the help of different sensors, including ultrasound and infrared, and to make use of autonomous algorithms to avoid obstacles. \\

Problem statement:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[•]Bot should be able to move from A to B
\item[•]Should be able to stop at a predetermined point
\item[•]Manoeuvre around obstacles
\end{enumerate}

\section{Problem analysis}
\subsection{Mobility from A to B}
The robot receives a coordinate to reach, and will use its own starting point to determine a direction to drive towards the given coordinate. The robot will utilize an H-bridge to control its motors and direct current through the motors.\
This way, the robot can effectively regulate speed and also steer itself autonomously.\

To dictate how much current the motors receive, the programming will utilize pulse width modulation (PWM), this allows the motors to have a determined ‘uptime’, so that it drives and steers in the desired way.\\

The robot will also utilize front-facing sensors to detect obstacles. In the case that it detects these, it will utilize ultra-sound to determine size and shape, so that it can navigate past these and continue on its path towards point B.\
