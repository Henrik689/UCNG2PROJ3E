In countries with high wages and where manual labour is expensive, the industrial production is often organized as an automated process. To make the whole industry smarter and more customizable, new automated robots and reliabilities are needed. The many new forms of robots rely on sensors to face the many different challenges.
Automation of movement and avoidance enables even robotic space exploration, as seen in the many rovers visiting the different nearby planets. \
 \\

There are different sensors in play when needing to avoid obstacles or collision. To mention a few, ultrasound, infra-red and laser sensors comes to mind, all of which are viable picks when building a robot with object avoidance.\\

In the project at hand, we will be focusing mainly on the ultrasound sensor for building an object avoiding robot. 
The objective of this project is to design and implement an automotive robot capable of autonomous object manoeuvring, specially a collision avoiding robot employing light detecting sensing and ultrasound sensing.\\

The project was handed to the group at the start of third semester and is to be handed in at the 9th of January, 2017.
